# Deep Research Guide

Deep Research is DeepWikiOpen's advanced multi-turn analysis feature that enables comprehensive investigation of complex topics through iterative AI-powered research cycles.

## What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is an intelligent research methodology that breaks down complex questions into manageable components, conducting thorough analysis through multiple iterative turns. Unlike traditional single-response queries, Deep Research employs a systematic approach:

1. **Planning Phase**: AI analyzes the question and creates a structured research plan
2. **Execution Phase**: Multiple research turns explore different aspects
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Findings are consolidated into comprehensive conclusions

### Core Components

- **Multi-turn Analysis**: Sequential research iterations building on previous findings
- **Adaptive Planning**: Research direction adjusts based on discovered information
- **Source Integration**: Combines multiple authoritative sources
- **Progressive Refinement**: Each turn deepens understanding and fills knowledge gaps

## Deep Research vs Regular Ask

| Feature | Regular Ask | Deep Research |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Single focused question | Complex, multi-faceted topics |
| **Process** | One-turn response | Multi-turn iterative analysis |
| **Depth** | Surface-level or specific facts | Comprehensive investigation |
| **Sources** | Limited source consultation | Extensive source integration |
| **Time** | Immediate response | Extended research process |
| **Complexity** | Simple to moderate | High complexity topics |

### When to Use Deep Research

**Choose Deep Research for:**
- Complex historical events with multiple perspectives
- Scientific topics requiring interdisciplinary analysis
- Market research spanning multiple industries
- Policy analysis with various stakeholder viewpoints
- Technical investigations requiring multiple sources

## The Deep Research Process

### 1. Research Planning

The AI begins by analyzing your question and creating a structured research plan:

```json
{
  "research_question": "How has climate change affected global food security?",
  "research_plan": [
    "Analyze climate change impacts on agriculture",
    "Examine regional variations in food production",
    "Investigate supply chain disruptions",
    "Study adaptation strategies and technologies",
    "Evaluate policy responses and effectiveness"
  ],
  "estimated_turns": 4-6,
  "key_sources": ["IPCC reports", "FAO data", "agricultural journals"]
}
```

### 2. Iterative Research Turns

Each research turn focuses on specific aspects:

**Turn 1: Foundation Building**
- Establish core concepts and definitions
- Identify primary data sources
- Map the research landscape

**Turn 2-N: Deep Dive Analysis**
- Explore specific subtopics
- Gather supporting evidence
- Identify patterns and connections

**Final Turn: Synthesis**
- Integrate findings across all turns
- Draw comprehensive conclusions
- Highlight limitations and future research needs

### 3. Progress Updates

Throughout the process, you receive real-time updates:

research_stats = {
    'input_tokens': 2500,      # Question + context
    'processing_tokens': 45000, # Multi-turn analysis
    'output_tokens': 8000,     # Final synthesis
    'total_cost': '$0.32'      # Estimated API cost
}
```

## Best Practices and Optimization Tips

### Question Formulation

**✅ Effective Deep Research Questions:**
- "How has cryptocurrency regulation evolved globally and what are the implications for adoption?"
- "What are the environmental and economic impacts of vertical farming technologies?"
- "How do different countries approach data privacy legislation and enforcement?"

**❌ Less Suitable for Deep Research:**
- "What is the capital of France?" (too simple)
- "How do I change a tire?" (procedural, not analytical)
- "What's the weather today?" (current, specific data)

### Scope Management

```markdown
## Research Scope Framework

### 🎯 Well-Scoped Questions
- Clear temporal boundaries (e.g., "since 2020", "in the next decade")
- Defined geographic focus (e.g., "in developed nations", "across Asia-Pacific")
- Specific industry/domain (e.g., "in healthcare", "for SMB companies")
- Measurable aspects (e.g., "economic impact", "user adoption rates")

### ⚠️ Overly Broad Questions
- "How does technology affect society?" → Too general
- "What is the future of business?" → Too vague
- "How does everything connect?" → No clear scope
```

### Source Quality Optimization

**High-Quality Source Preferences:**
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Government and institutional reports
- Industry analysis from recognized firms
- Primary research and surveys
- Expert interviews and case studies

**Source Validation Indicators:**
- Author credentials and affiliations
- Publication date and relevance
- Citation count and impact factor
- Methodology transparency
- Cross-reference validation

### Iterative Refinement

```python
# Example of research refinement workflow
refinement_process = {
    'initial_question': 'How is AI changing education?',
    'refined_questions': [
        'How is AI being implemented in K-12 education systems?',
        'What are the learning outcomes of AI-powered educational tools?',
        'How do educators perceive AI integration in classrooms?',
        'What are the equity implications of AI in education?'
    ],
    'focus_areas': [
        'implementation_models',
        'effectiveness_metrics',
        'teacher_training',
        'accessibility_concerns'
    ]
}
```

### Quality Assurance

**Research Quality Metrics:**
- **Source Diversity**: Multiple perspectives and methodologies
- **Temporal Coverage**: Recent and historical context
- **Evidence Strength**: Primary data and expert consensus
- **Bias Mitigation**: Balanced viewpoint representation
- **Completeness**: Addressing all aspects of the question

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Question Too Narrow**: Results in shallow, limited analysis
2. **Unrealistic Time Expectations**: Complex topics need adequate research time
3. **Source Bias**: Over-relying on single source types or viewpoints
4. **Scope Creep**: Allowing research to expand beyond useful boundaries
5. **Insufficient Context**: Not providing relevant background information

### Integration with Regular Ask

```

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Research Updates

Enable live progress tracking:

```javascript
// WebSocket connection for real-time updates
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepwikiopen.com/v1/research-stream');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log(`Turn ${update.turn}: ${update.status}`);
    console.log(`Sources analyzed: ${update.sources_count}`);
    console.log(`Current focus: ${update.current_focus}`);
};
```

### Collaborative Research

Multiple researchers can contribute to the same deep research session:

```python
# Add collaborative researchers
collaboration_config = {
    'research_id': research_id,
    'collaborators': [
        {'role': 'domain_expert', 'focus': 'technical_analysis'},
        {'role': 'market_analyst', 'focus': 'commercial_implications'},
        {'role': 'policy_expert', 'focus': 'regulatory_landscape'}
    ],
    'coordination_mode': 'parallel_with_synthesis'
}
```

### Research Templates

Use pre-configured research templates for common analysis types:

```python
# Market analysis template
market_template = {
    'template_id': 'market_analysis_v2',
    'standard_turns': [
        'market_size_and_trends',
        'competitive_landscape',
        'customer_segments',
        'regulatory_environment',
        'future_projections'
    ],
    'required_sources': ['industry_reports', 'financial_data', 'market_surveys'],
    'output_format': 'executive_summary_with_appendices'
}
```

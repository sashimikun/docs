# What's New in DeepWiki-Open

Stay up to date with the latest features, improvements, and changes in DeepWiki-Open.

## Recent Updates

### üöÄ GPT-5 Support Added (Commit: 05693d5)
*August 7, 2025*

DeepWiki now supports OpenAI's GPT-5 model as the default for documentation generation!

<Card title="GPT-5 Integration" icon="robot">
**Key Changes:**
- GPT-5 is now the default OpenAI model
- Temperature set to 1.0 for optimal creative yet accurate responses
- Fallback to GPT-4o when GPT-5 is unavailable
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex codebases

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "openai": {
    "default_model": "gpt-5",
    "models": {
      "gpt-5": {
        "temperature": 1.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Card>

<Note>
Ensure your OpenAI account has GPT-5 API access. Check regional availability as GPT-5 may have limited rollout initially.
</Note>

### üèóÔ∏è Centralized Prompt Management (Commit: 36777d3)
*August 8, 2025*

Major refactoring to centralize all AI prompts for better maintainability and consistency.

<Card title="Prompt Architecture" icon="brain">
**Improvements:**
- All prompts now managed in `api/prompts.py`
- Consistent formatting and language detection
- Separate prompts for RAG, Deep Research, and Simple Chat
- Better template management with Jinja2-style formatting

**New Structure:**
- `RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - Core RAG functionality
- `DEEP_RESEARCH_*_PROMPT` - Three-stage research prompts
- `SIMPLE_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - Direct Q&A responses
- `RAG_TEMPLATE` - Unified template structure
</Card>

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for all prompts
- ‚úÖ Easier testing and validation
- ‚úÖ Consistent user experience
- ‚úÖ Simplified prompt updates and versioning

### ‚ö° Repository Cloning Performance Optimization (Commit: f79554f)
*August 8, 2025*

Significant performance improvement for repository cloning operations.

<Card title="Clone Optimization" icon="bolt">
**Performance Gains:**
| Repository Size | Time Saved | Size Reduction |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Small (<100MB) | 80% | 70% |
| Medium (100MB-1GB) | 90% | 85% |
| Large (1-10GB) | 95% | 90% |
| Massive (>10GB) | 98% | 95% |

**Technical Details:**
- Added `--depth=1` flag for shallow cloning
- Added `--single-branch` flag to fetch only main branch
- Reduces bandwidth usage dramatically
- Perfect for documentation generation where history isn't needed
</Card>

**Implementation:**
```python
# Optimized clone command
subprocess.run(
    ["git", "clone", "--depth=1", "--single-branch", clone_url, local_path],
    check=True,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
)
```

## Migration Guide

### Updating to GPT-5

If you're currently using GPT-4o, follow these steps to migrate:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check API Access">
Verify your OpenAI account has GPT-5 access by checking your API dashboard
</Step>

<Step title="Update Configuration">
Update your `generator.json` or environment variables to use GPT-5:
```json
{
  "openai": {
    "default_model": "gpt-5"
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Test Generation">
Run a test generation on a small repository to verify GPT-5 is working:
```bash
# Test with a simple repository
python -m api.main --repo https://github.com/simple/test-repo --model gpt-5
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Fallback">
Set up GPT-4o as a fallback in case GPT-5 is unavailable:
```json
{
  "openai": {
    "default_model": "gpt-5",
    "fallback_model": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Performance Optimization Tips

To take advantage of the new cloning optimizations:

1. **Clear Old Caches**: Remove old full clones to save disk space
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.adalflow/repos/*
   ```

2. **Monitor Clone Times**: The new shallow clone should complete in seconds even for large repos

3. **Adjust Timeouts**: You can now reduce clone timeouts since operations are much faster
   ```python
   CLONE_TIMEOUT = 30  # Reduced from 300 seconds
   ```

## Breaking Changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Version Compatibility

- **Prompt System**: Custom prompts may need updating to work with the new centralized system
- **Model Selection**: Default model changed from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-5` - ensure API access
- **Clone Behavior**: Shallow clones mean git history operations won't work

## üöÄ Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepwikiopen/deepwikiopen-docs.git
cd deepwikiopen-docs

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Create a development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Add any required environment variables
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

We maintain consistent code style to ensure readability and maintainability.

### General Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** and **Prettier** configurations
- Write **self-documenting code** with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions **small and focused** (single responsibility)
- Use **meaningful commit messages** following conventional commits

### TypeScript Style

```typescript
// Good example
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

export async function getUserById(id: string): Promise<UserData | null> {
  try {
    const user = await db.users.findById(id);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### React/Component Style

```tsx
// Good component example
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export function Button({ 
  label, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary', 
  disabled = false 
}: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Lint your code
npm run lint

# Format with Prettier
npm run format

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests.

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Example unit test
describe('getUserById', () => {
  it('should return user data when user exists', async () => {
    const userId = 'test-123';
    const result = await getUserById(userId);
    
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result?.id).toBe(userId);
  });

  it('should return null when user does not exist', async () => {
    const result = await getUserById('non-existent');
    expect(result).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Maintain **minimum 80% code coverage**
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests

## üìö Documentation Standards

Good documentation is crucial for project success.

### Documentation Types

1. **Code Comments** - Explain complex logic
2. **API Documentation** - Document all public APIs
3. **User Guides** - Help users understand features
4. **Developer Guides** - Help contributors understand the codebase

### Documentation Style

```typescript
/**
 * Fetches user data by ID from the database.
 * 
 * @param id - The unique identifier of the user
 * @returns Promise resolving to UserData or null if not found
 * @throws {DatabaseError} When database connection fails
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const user = await getUserById('user-123');
 * if (user) {
 *   console.log(user.name);
 * }
 * ```
 */
export async function getUserById(id: string): Promise<UserData | null> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### MDX Documentation

When writing MDX documentation:

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add visual aids when helpful
- Structure content with proper headings
- Include a table of contents for long documents

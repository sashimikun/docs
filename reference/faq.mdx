## API Keys and Authentication

### Do I need an API key to use DeepWiki?

DeepWiki offers both free and premium features:
- **Free tier**: Basic documentation generation, no API key required
- **Premium features**: AI-powered search, advanced analysis, requires API key

### How do I get an API key?

2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate your personal API key

### Where do I put my API key?

You have several options:

```bash
# Environment variable (recommended)
export DEEPWIKI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Or in .env file
DEEPWIKI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Or during initialization
deepwiki init --api-key your-api-key-here
```

### Is my API key secure?

Yes! DeepWiki:
- Never stores API keys in generated documentation
- Uses HTTPS for all API communications
- Supports environment variable configuration
- Excludes `.env` files from documentation by default

## Model Selection and Costs

### What AI models does DeepWiki use?

DeepWiki supports multiple AI models:
- **GPT-4**: Best quality, higher cost
- **GPT-3.5**: Good balance of quality and cost
- **Claude**: Excellent for technical documentation
- **Local models**: Privacy-focused, no API costs

### How much does it cost?

Pricing depends on your usage:
- **Free tier**: 10,000 tokens/month
- **Starter**: $19/month for 100,000 tokens
- **Professional**: $49/month for 500,000 tokens
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

### Can I control costs?

Yes! DeepWiki provides cost controls:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "monthlyBudget": 50,
    "warningThreshold": 0.8,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  }
}
```

### How do I estimate token usage?

Rule of thumb:
- Small project (< 10k LOC): ~50k tokens
- Medium project (10k-100k LOC): ~200k tokens
- Large project (> 100k LOC): ~500k+ tokens

## Private Repository Support

### Can DeepWiki work with private repositories?

Yes! DeepWiki works perfectly with private repositories:
- Runs locally on your machine

- Hardware: Faster with more CPU cores

### Can DeepWiki handle large codebases?

Yes! DeepWiki scales well:
- Tested on codebases with 1M+ lines
- Incremental updates for efficiency
- Parallel processing support
- Smart caching to reduce regeneration

### How can I improve performance?

Tips for better performance:

```json
{
  "performance": {
    "parallel": true,
    "maxWorkers": 8,
    "incremental": true,
    "cache": true
  }
}
```

### Does DeepWiki support monorepos?

Absolutely! DeepWiki has excellent monorepo support:
- Configure multiple documentation sites

3. Check file patterns in config
4. Verify git status for changes

### AI features not working

Common fixes:
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API quota isn't exceeded
- Try different AI model

### Build errors

For build issues:
